# zjstatus-hints

A [Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) plugin that displays context-aware key bindings for each Zellij mode. Extends the functionality of [zjstatus](https://github.com/dj95/zjstatus).

## Rationale

Zjstatus is an excellent plugin, but it lacks the ability to display keybinding hints for your current mode, as the built-in Zellij status-bar plugin allows. This plugin adds that functionality to zjstatus, so you can have the best of both worlds.

## What this fork adds

The original shows a [curated list](docs/hints.md#the-curated-list) of hints and
pipes it to zjstatus, with four configuration options. This fork keeps that
behaviour and builds a configuration layer over it:

- **[Styling](docs/styling.md)** — global and per-hint format strings, colours,
  and key/modifier aliases, so `Ctrl Left` can read `^←`
- **[Discovery](docs/hints.md#discovered-hints)** — optionally surface **every**
  keybinding your config enables, not just the curated set
- **[Labels](docs/labels.md)** — rename, hide, merge, or reorder any hint,
  globally or in a single mode
- **[Ordering](docs/ordering.md)** — keyboard-layout-aware key order, and a
  pinned order for the hints themselves
- **[Fitting](docs/fitting.md)** — drop whole hints to fit the terminal as it
  narrows, in an order you choose, with an optional indicator for what was cut
- **Zellij 0.44** support

Four options upstream, around two dozen here — the full list is in the
[configuration reference](docs/configuration.md).

## Installation

First, install and configure [zjstatus](https://github.com/dj95/zjstatus). Then, add the zjstatus-hints plugin to your Zellij configuration:

```kdl
plugins {
    zjstatus-hints location="https://github.com/myah-mitchell/zjstatus-hints/releases/latest/download/zjstatus-hints.wasm" {
        // Hard cap on the width of the hint line, in columns
        max_length 0 // 0 = unlimited
        // Fit the hints to the terminal, dropping trailing hints as it
        // narrows. Reserve columns for whatever shares the bar.
        auto_width true // default
        reserve_columns 0 // default
        // Set to 2 if your terminal draws Nerd Font glyphs double-width.
        ambiguous_width 1 // default
        // Appended when a single hint is too wide to fit even alone
        overflow_str "..." // default
        // Name of the pipe for zjstatus integration
        pipe_name "zjstatus_hints" // default
        // Hide hints in base mode (a.k.a. default mode)
        // E.g. if you have set default_mode to "locked", then
        // you can hide hints in the locked mode by setting this to true
        hide_in_base_mode false // default

        // Also show every other keybinding your config enables, beyond the
        // curated list. See docs/hints.md.
        discover_hints false // default
        // Hide bindings that every mode inherits from the base mode, so each
        // mode only advertises what is new in it. See docs/hints.md.
        hide_shared_hints true // default
        // When a hint is bound to both hjkl and the arrows, show only one
        // family: "both" (default), "arrows", or "letters".
        direction_keys "both" // default
        // How keys within a hint are ordered: a keyboard layout
        // ("qwerty", "dvorak", "colemak"), "abcdef", or "none".
        key_order "qwerty" // default
        // Pin hints to the start or end of each mode; "*" is everything
        // else. Unset leaves the order each mode builds.
        hint_order "*, exit"
        // Override or hide any hint's label by its concept id; an empty
        // value hides it. See docs/labels.md for the full list of ids.
        label_mode_locked "lock"
        label_split_down  "split ↓"

        // Optionally style the hints using zjstatus-style format strings.
        // When unset, the current Zellij theme palette is used automatically.
        // `{key}` and `{desc}` are replaced with the keybinding and its label.
        // See docs/styling.md for the full syntax.
        key_format  "#[fg=$black,bg=$blue,bold] {key} "
        desc_format "#[fg=$fg,bg=$bg] {desc} "
        // Drawn between hints (never before the first or after the last).
        // Also a format string, so it can be a styled glyph, not just space.
        hint_spacer "#[fg=$fg] │ "
        // Shown where hints were dropped because the window is too narrow.
        drop_indicator "#[fg=$fg]…"
        // Which pinned group outlives the other: "tl" or "lt".
        hint_precedence "tl" // default

        // `$name` colors resolve to the matching `color_<name>` option, exactly
        // like zjstatus color aliases.
        color_black "#1e1e2e"
        color_blue  "#89b4fa"
        color_fg    "#cdd6f4"
        color_bg    "#313244"

        // Optionally replace key names with symbols, e.g. show ENTER as ↵.
        // Uses the same per-line alias pattern (see docs/styling.md).
        key_alias_enter "↵"
        key_alias_space "␣"
        key_alias_esc   "⎋"

        // Likewise for modifiers: show Ctrl as ^ and Alt as ⌥.
        mod_alias_ctrl "^"
        mod_alias_alt  "⌥"
    }
}

load_plugins {
    // Load at startup
    zjstatus-hints
}
```

### Release channels

Three channels are published:

| Channel | Contents |
|---|---|
| `latest` | Tagged releases. What the URL above resolves to. |
| `nightly` | Rebuilt from `main` every night, tests green. Prerelease. |
| `zellij-<line>` | The newest release built for a given Zellij minor, e.g. `zellij-0.44`. |

Zellij caches remote plugins by URL, so pointing the config at the nightly URL
will keep serving whatever it downloaded first. To track nightlies, fetch into
the plugin path instead and start a new session:

```sh
make nightly   # or: make latest
```

#### Matching your Zellij version

`latest` is not always built for the Zellij you run — this plugin's own
version and the Zellij it targets move independently (see
[Versioning](#versioning) below). Mixing them is silent, not a build error:
Zellij's plugin boundary decodes a binding's actions with
`.filter_map(|a| a.try_into().ok())`, so an action a mismatched plugin does
not recognise is just dropped — hints render with the wrong label rather than
failing to load.

Check what your build targets, or fetch one for the Zellij you actually run:

```sh
zellij --version                 # e.g. 0.44.3
make zellij VERSION=0.44         # newest release built for that line
```

`zellij-<line>` always resolves to the newest `zjstatus-hints` release built
for that Zellij minor, however many versions have shipped since — the same
moving-pointer pattern as `latest` and `nightly`, just scoped to one Zellij
line instead of to everything.

### Versioning

`zjstatus-hints`'s own version and the Zellij it targets move on separate
tracks, on purpose: this fork ships its own features and fixes on its own
schedule, unrelated to when Zellij releases. Folding the two into one number
would make a plain bugfix release indistinguishable from a Zellij compatibility
bump.

| `zjstatus-hints` | Targets Zellij |
|---|---|
| 0.2.x (current) | 0.44.x |

Bumping past a Zellij minor is deliberately not automatic — see
[docs/AUTOMATION.md](docs/AUTOMATION.md) for why and how that update is
proposed instead of applied. Once it lands, this table's current row moves to
the new line, and the previous line's last compatible release stays reachable
forever at its own `zellij-<line>` tag.

Finally, configure zjstatus to display the hints in your default layout (`layouts/default.kdl`):

```kdl
layout {
    default_tab_template {
        children
        pane size=1 borderless=true {
            plugin location="zjstatus" {
                format_left   "{mode} {tabs}"

                // You can put `{pipe_zjstatus_hints}` inside of format_left, format_center, or format_right.
                // The pipe name should match the pipe_name configuration option from above, which is zjstatus_hints by default.
                // e.g. pipe_<pipe_name>
                format_right  "{pipe_zjstatus_hints}{datetime} " 

                // Note: this is necessary or else zjstatus won't render the pipe:
                pipe_zjstatus_hints_format "{output}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Configuration

The plugin works with no configuration — this section is only if you want to
change something. Every option and its default is in the **[configuration
reference](docs/configuration.md)**; the detail behind each group lives in its
own page:

| Topic | What it covers |
|---|---|
| **[Styling](docs/styling.md)** | Format strings, colors, per-hint styling, key and modifier aliases |
| **[Keys and ordering](docs/ordering.md)** | Which keys show for a hint, and the order of keys and of hints |
| **[Fitting the bar](docs/fitting.md)** | Fitting to the terminal, dropping hints, the drop indicator |
| **[Hints](docs/hints.md)** | The curated list, discovery, and shared bindings |
| **[Labels](docs/labels.md)** | Renaming, hiding, merging, and per-mode labels |

## TODO

- [x] configurable colors/formatting
- [x] more advanced mode-specific configuration
- [x] improved handling of long outputs
- [x] ability to enable/disable specific hints
- [ ] shed the unmaintained transitive crates, once Zellij allows it. Five
      RUSTSEC advisories are open, all warning-level (unmaintained / unsound
      reads, no vulnerabilities) and none reachable in the actual wasm plugin:
      `ansi_term` (RUSTSEC-2021-0139) via `zellij-tile-utils`; `atty`
      (RUSTSEC-2021-0145, RUSTSEC-2024-0375) and `proc-macro-error`
      (RUSTSEC-2024-0370) via `clap 3`/`clap_derive` in `zellij-utils`
      (`proc-macro-error` is a proc-macro crate, so it never ships in any
      compiled output, wasm or host); and `event-listener` (RUSTSEC-2026-0221)
      via `isahc` in `zellij-utils` — that whole chain (`isahc` → `curl` →
      `openssl-sys`) is absent from the `wasm32-wasip1` dependency graph
      entirely, only appearing on the host target that `cargo test` builds.
      **None is removable from here** — swapping our own `ansi_term` for
      `nu-ansi-term` only adds a second ANSI crate, since `zellij-tile-utils`
      still pulls `ansi_term`, and the `clap 3`/`isahc` advisories only leave
      when Zellij moves off them. They clear when Zellij updates; `cargo
      audit` already passes, as these are warnings, not vulnerabilities.
- [x] reconsider the `select` hint — dropped. It labelled Enter separately in
      seven modes, but Enter and Esc are bound to the identical
      `SwitchToMode "Normal"`, so it spent a hint on a distinction Zellij does
      not make. Both keys now form one `mode_normal` hint.
