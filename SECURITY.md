# Security policy

## Supported versions

This is a personal fork maintained on a rolling basis. Fixes go to the latest
release; there are no maintenance branches for older ones.

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| 0.2.x | Yes |
| 0.1.x | No — upgrade to 0.2 |
| `nightly` | Built from `main`, unreleased. Fixes land here first. |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for a security problem.**

Use GitHub's private reporting instead:

1. Go to the [Security tab][security] of this repository.
2. **Report a vulnerability**.
3. Describe the issue, how to reproduce it, and what an attacker could do.

That opens a private advisory visible only to maintainers, where a fix can be
discussed and prepared before anything is disclosed.

If you cannot use that, contact the maintainer through their GitHub profile and
say only that you have a security report — do not include the details in a
public channel.

### What to expect

- **Acknowledgement** within a week. This is a personal project, so please allow
  for that rather than assuming silence means dismissal.
- **An assessment** of whether it is exploitable and how serious it looks.
- **A fix** released as a patch version, with credit in the release notes unless
  you would rather not be named.

## What is in scope

This plugin is a WebAssembly module that Zellij runs. It reads your keybindings,
formats a string, and pipes it to zjstatus. Realistic concerns:

- **Malicious configuration causing unsafe behaviour.** Config values are
  rendered into the status bar; a crafted value that escapes the intended output
  or causes a crash would be a bug worth reporting.
- **Terminal escape sequence injection.** The plugin emits ANSI sequences. A way
  to get arbitrary sequences into the bar via config or keybinding names could
  affect the surrounding terminal.
- **Dependency vulnerabilities.** `cargo audit` runs on every push, but an
  advisory we have not noticed is worth flagging.
- **Supply chain issues in the release pipeline.** The workflows publish the
  wasm binary people install; problems there affect everyone downstream.

## What is not in scope

- **Zellij or zjstatus vulnerabilities.** Report those to their projects —
  [zellij][zellij-security], [zjstatus][zjstatus-repo].
- **Your own configuration exposing information you put in it.** The plugin
  displays what your config tells it to.
- Anything requiring an attacker to already have write access to your
  `config.kdl` or your plugin directory. At that point they can run arbitrary
  code as you regardless.

## Verifying what you install

Releases are built by GitHub Actions from a tagged commit — see
[docs/AUTOMATION.md](docs/AUTOMATION.md) — so the build is reproducible from
public source. If you would rather not trust the published binary, build it
yourself:

```sh
git checkout v0.2.1
make build
```

The result lands at `target/wasm32-wasip1/release/zjstatus-hints.wasm`.
