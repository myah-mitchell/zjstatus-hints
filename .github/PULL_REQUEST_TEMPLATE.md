## What this changes

<!-- The "why" more than the "what"; the diff already shows the what. -->

## Why

<!--
What problem does this solve? If it fixes an issue, link it:
  Fixes #123
-->

## How it was verified

<!--
Rendering bugs here have a habit of being something other than they appear —
a glyph that does not render in one terminal, a plugin cached from a previous
session, a version mismatch showing up as a wrong label. Saying what you
actually observed helps.
-->

- [ ] `make check` passes (fmt, clippy, tests, release build)
- [ ] Tried it in a **new** Zellij session — plugins are cached per session, so
      detach/reattach does not reload
- [ ] Added or updated tests for anything with logic worth reasoning about

Modes exercised, if the change affects rendering:

<!-- e.g. Normal, Pane, Tab, Locked; with discover_hints both on and off -->

## Documentation

- [ ] New config options have a bullet in the README's Configuration list
      **and** a prose section
- [ ] Not applicable

## Anything else

<!--
Trade-offs, alternatives you rejected, things you are unsure about, or parts
you would like a closer look at. Uncertainty flagged here is more useful than
uncertainty discovered later.
