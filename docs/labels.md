# Labels

Every hint is two things: the **keys** it shows, and the **label** — the words
printed next to them. This section is about changing those words.

## Ids and labels

Each hint has both a label and an **id**:

- The **label** is what you see — `split down`, `focus`, `exit`.
- The **id** is the hint's permanent name, which is never displayed —
  `split_down`, `focus`, `mode_normal`.

Most ids look like their label with underscores, which makes them easy to guess,
but the two do different jobs and keeping them apart is what makes everything
here work.

**The id is the config key.** `label_split_down "↓"` means *find the hint whose
id is `split_down`, and change its label to `↓`*. You can relabel a hint as often
as you like and its id never moves, so your config keeps working.

**The id is also the merge key.** Two bindings that resolve to the same id become
one hint showing all of their keys. This is why ids exist at all, rather than
just matching on the displayed text:

- Zellij binds focus-left, focus-down, focus-up and focus-right as four separate
  actions. All four resolve to the id `focus`, so they merge into a single
  `hjkl focus` hint instead of cluttering the bar with four.
- Pane mode's "new pane" and Tab mode's "new tab" both *display* `new`. Their ids
  differ (`new_pane`, `new_tab`), so they stay separate — and
  `label_new_tab "＋"` changes only the tab one.

Matching on displayed text would get the first case right and the second wrong.
Ids get both.

## Changing a label

Name the id, give it the text you want:

```kdl
label_split_down  "split ↓"
label_focus       "◆"
label_mode_locked "lock"
label_next_layout "»"
label_mouse       ""      // empty string hides this hint entirely
```

This works for **every** hint, whether it came from the
[curated list](hints.md#the-curated-list) or from [discovery](hints.md#discovered-hints).

## Finding a hint's id

Two cases:

1. **It is in the table below.** Those are the hints the plugin has hand-picked
   ids and labels for.
2. **It is not.** Then the id is the Zellij action's name in `snake_case`, and
   the label is that same name with the underscores turned into spaces. So a
   hint reading `next swap layout` has the id `next_swap_layout`, and
   `label_next_swap_layout "»"` renames it.

That second rule is why nothing is ever unlabelled and every hint is
addressable, including bindings this plugin has never heard of.

## Ids

The hints with hand-picked ids, and the label each shows unless you change it.
Rows are grouped roughly by the mode they turn up in. Where the label column says
"same", the label is the id with spaces instead of underscores.

| Id | Default label |
|---|---|
| `mode_normal`, `mode_locked`, `mode_pane`, `mode_tab`, `mode_resize`, `mode_move`, `mode_scroll`, `mode_search`, `mode_session`, `mode_rename`, `mode_tmux`, `mode_prompt` | the mode name (`lock` for locked) |
| `new_pane`, `close_pane`, `split_left`, `split_right`, `split_up`, `split_down` | `new`, `close`, `split …` |
| `stacked_pane`, `floating_pane`, `in_place_pane` | `stacked`, `floating`, `in place` |
| `fullscreen`, `float`, `embed`, `frames`, `pin` | same |
| `group_pane`, `group_marking` | `group`, `mark` |
| `focus`, `move_pane`, `move_pane_back`, `next_pane`, `prev_pane`, `toggle_focus` | `focus`, `move`, `move back`, `next`, `prev`, `toggle focus` |
| `new_tab`, `close_tab`, `next_tab`, `prev_tab`, `go_to_tab`, `toggle_tab`, `sync`, `move_tab` | `new`, `close`, `next`, `prev`, `tab`, `toggle`, `sync`, `move tab` |
| `break_pane`, `break_left`, `break_right` | `break …` |
| `resize`, `increase`, `decrease` | same |
| `scroll`, `page`, `half_page`, `top`, `bottom`, `edit` | same (`half page`) |
| `search_down`, `search_up`, `search_toggle` | `down`, `up`, `toggle` |
| `copy`, `clear`, `mouse`, `prev_layout`, `next_layout`, `confirm`, `deny`, `quit`, `detach`, `undo_rename`, `rename_session` | same (`prev layout`, `next layout`, `undo`, `rename`) |
| `rename`, `manager`, `config`, `plugins`, `about`, `share` | same |
| `layout_manager` | `layouts` |

Anything not listed falls back to the rule above: the action's own snake_case
name serves as both id and label.

## By action name

A hint can also be addressed by the **Zellij action** behind it, using that
action's snake_case name with any direction appended. These two are the same
hint:

```kdl
label_split_down    "↓"   // by id
label_new_pane_down "↓"   // by the action, NewPane "Down"
```

More examples: `label_move_focus_left`, `label_resize_increase_left`,
`label_switch_to_mode_locked`.

Ids are usually the better choice — they are shorter, and some hints are built
from several actions at once (`resize` covers four, `mode_normal` gathers every
key that leaves the mode), so they have no single action name to use. Reach for
the action form when you already know the Zellij action and would rather not
look one up.

If both are set for the same hint, the id wins.

## Per-mode labels

Prefixing a mode name scopes a label to that mode alone:

```kdl
label_mode_normal        "exit"   // every mode
label_locked_mode_normal "unlock" // …except Locked, which says "unlock"
```

Useful where one action means different things in different modes. Leaving
Locked is an unlock; leaving Pane mode is just an exit.

Mode names are the lowercased Zellij modes — `normal`, `locked`, `pane`, `tab`,
`resize`, `move`, `scroll`, `search`, `session`, `renametab`, `renamepane`,
`tmux`, `prompt` — and the suffix is an id or an action name, both of which work
scoped:

```kdl
label_locked_switch_to_mode_normal "unlock" // same thing, by action
```

Lookup runs most specific first, so a mode-scoped label always beats a global
one:

1. `label_<mode>_<id>`
2. `label_<mode>_<action>`
3. `label_<id>`
4. `label_<action>`

An empty value still hides, at whichever scope you set it — so
`label_pane_mode_normal ""` drops the hint in Pane mode and leaves it elsewhere.
The reverse works too: hide globally with `label_mode_normal ""`, then bring it
back in one mode with `label_locked_mode_normal "unlock"`.

## Combining hints

Hints normally merge only when they share an [id](#ids-and-labels). There is one
deliberate exception: giving two hints the **same label yourself** merges them
too, gathering all their keys into one hint.

```kdl
label_next_layout "swap layout"
label_prev_layout "swap layout"   // one hint, both keys
```

Next-layout and previous-layout are separate actions with separate ids, so by
default they are two hints. Labelling both `swap layout` says *treat these as one
thing*, and they collapse into a single hint carrying both keys.

This applies only to labels **you** set. Hints that merely ship with the same
built-in label — Pane's `new` and Tab's `new` — stay separate, so a merge is
always something you asked for rather than an accident of the default table.

One consequence worth knowing: a merged hint's id becomes the label you chose,
so [`hint_order`](ordering.md#hint-order) should refer to it by that label.
