# Fitting the bar

The hint line grows with the number of bindings a mode has, and can easily
exceed the terminal. By default the plugin fits it to the available width,
**dropping whole hints** rather than cutting one in half — you choose which
ones go, and they can be replaced by an indicator:

```kdl
auto_width      true // default — fit to the terminal
reserve_columns 0    // columns to leave for the rest of the bar
max_length      0    // hard cap; 0 = none
```

Width is learned from Zellij's pane geometry, since the plugin runs headless and
has no view of the status bar itself. It measures the right edge of the widest
visible tiled pane; floating and suppressed panes are ignored, as neither tracks
the terminal's real width. Until the first pane update arrives no width is
assumed, so nothing is cut on a guess.

`reserve_columns` is what keeps room for anything sharing the bar. The plugin
cannot see zjstatus's `format_right`, so if you have one, reserve roughly its
width:

```kdl
format_left  "{pipe_zjstatus_hints}"
format_right "{command_user}@{command_host}:{session}" // ≈30 columns
```

```kdl
reserve_columns 32
```

`max_length` acts as a hard cap alongside this. With both set the smaller wins,
so an explicit cap is never exceeded on a wide terminal. Set `auto_width false`
to ignore the terminal entirely and use the fixed cap alone.

## Glyph width

Fitting depends on measuring how many **columns** the hints occupy, which is not
the same as counting characters — a CJK ideograph or an emoji takes two.

Nerd Font glyphs are East Asian **Ambiguous**: one column by the Unicode
standard, but two in a terminal actually set up to display them. If you use them
in `key_alias_*` or `mod_alias_*` and the hints overflow slightly — fitting looks
right on wide windows and breaks near the edge — set:

```kdl
ambiguous_width 2
```

Getting this wrong under-counts every such glyph, so the plugin believes the
line fits while the terminal wraps or clips it.

## What gets dropped

[`hint_order`](ordering.md#hint-order) decides what survives. Unpinned hints — the `*`, the
ones you never spoke for — are given up first, starting with the rightmost:

```kdl
hint_order "*, exit" // exit outlives the hints in the "*"
```

So on a narrowing window the middle thins out while `exit` stays put, rather
than `exit` being the first thing over the edge.

When the `*` runs out, dropping continues **outward from that same gap**: the
leading group is consumed from its inner edge, then the trailing group from
its inner edge. Hints given up therefore always form one contiguous run, so a
single indicator can stand for all of them:

```
new close split float frames pin exit   ← everything fits
new close split … exit                  ← the "*" thinning out
new … exit                              ← leading group being consumed
… exit                                  ← trailing group is last to go
```

Dropping from the far ends instead would open a second gap and need a second
indicator.

A single hint wider than the whole bar survives this and is cut with
`overflow_str` as a last resort.

### Which pinned group goes first

`hint_precedence` names the pinned groups in the order they are held onto,
reading like zjstatus's `format_precedence`:

```kdl
hint_precedence "tl" // default — trailing kept, leading spent first
hint_precedence "lt" // leading kept, trailing spent first
```

With the default, a hint pinned to the end outlives one pinned to the front:

```kdl
hint_order      "new, *, exit"
hint_precedence "tl"
```

```
new … exit   ← the "*" is gone
… exit       ← "new" spent
exit         ← trailing group is last
```

Reverse it with `"lt"` if the hints you pin to the front are the ones you most
want kept. Either way the dropped hints stay one contiguous run, so a single
`drop_indicator` still covers them. The `*` is always spent first, whichever
precedence is set.

## Marking the gap

`drop_indicator` is rendered in place of the dropped run:

```kdl
drop_indicator "#[fg=$grey]…"
```

It is a format string like `hint_spacer`, so it can be styled, and it is spaced
like a hint so it reads as one. It costs columns of its own, which come out of
the same budget — a wide indicator forces one more hint to drop rather than
pushing the line over the limit.

Left unset, hints are dropped silently.
