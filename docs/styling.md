# Styling

Each hint is rendered in two parts: the **key** (e.g. `Ctrl + p`) and its
**description** (e.g. `pane`). By default both are styled from the active Zellij
theme palette so they blend in with the rest of your status bar.

To customize them, set `key_format` and/or `desc_format`. These use the same
format-string syntax as any other [zjstatus](https://github.com/dj95/zjstatus)
widget, so styling hints works just like styling `{mode}`, `{tabs}`, and friends:

- Wrap styling directives in `#[...]`; everything after a block is painted with
  that style until the next block.
- `{key}` and `{desc}` are placeholders substituted with the keybinding text and
  its label, respectively.
- If either option is unset (or empty), that part falls back to the theme palette,
  so you can restyle just the keys, just the descriptions, or both.

```kdl
key_format  "#[fg=$black,bg=$blue,bold] {key} "
desc_format "#[fg=#cdd6f4,bg=#313244,italic] {desc} "
```

## Styling one hint

`key_format` and `desc_format` set the look of every hint. Suffixing an id
changes one of them:

```kdl
desc_format      "#[fg=$fg,bg=$bg] {desc} "   // every hint
desc_format_quit "#[fg=$red,bg=$bg,bold] {desc} "   // …except quit
key_format_quit  "#[fg=$red,bg=$bg,bold] {key} "
```

Useful for the hints that are not like the others — a destructive action worth
colouring, or the way out of a mode worth setting apart from the actions in it.

Resolution runs most specific first, and can be scoped to a mode exactly as
[labels](labels.md#per-mode-labels) can:

1. `key_format_<mode>_<id>`
2. `key_format_<mode>_<label>`
3. `key_format_<id>`
4. `key_format_<label>`
5. `key_format` — the global setting
6. the theme palette

A hint can be named by its [id](labels.md#ids) or by its label, with spaces written as
underscores. The label form matters for hints you have
[fused](labels.md#combining-hints) under a shared label, whose internal id is that label
with a marker prefix:

```kdl
label_next_layout "swap layout"
label_prev_layout "swap layout"
key_format_swap_layout "#[fg=$mauve]{key} "   // addresses the merged hint
```

An empty value falls back to the theme palette, the same as leaving the global
option unset.

## Replacing the keys

`keys_<id>` substitutes a fixed string for a hint's keys:

```kdl
keys_go_to_tab "1-9"      // instead of 123456789
keys_focus     "hjkl/←↓↑→"
keys_mouse     "🖱"
```

For hints better described than enumerated — a long run of keys standing in as
a range, or an action whose real binding says little. The string is used
verbatim: [key aliases](#key-aliases) and [key ordering](ordering.md#key-order) do not
apply to it, since there are no keys left to alias or sort.

It is still measured at its real width, so [fitting](fitting.md#fitting-the-bar) accounts
for a replacement that is wider than what it replaced.

An empty value drops the key part altogether, leaving the label to stand alone:

```kdl
keys_mouse ""   // renders as just "mouse"
```

This addresses hints the same way `key_format_<id>` does, mode scoping
included.

## Spacing

By default hints sit directly against one another. `hint_spacer` inserts a
separator **between** consecutive hints — never before the first or after the
last, so it never leaks into the edges of the piped output:

```kdl
hint_spacer "  "             // just widen the gap
hint_spacer "#[fg=$grey] │ " // a styled divider
```

It is parsed as a format string like `key_format` and `desc_format` (it just has
no placeholders), so `$name` color aliases and all the directives below work in
it. Note that the default key styling already emits one leading space per hint,
so the spacer adds to that gap rather than replacing it.

## Directives

Inside `#[...]`, comma-separate any of the following:

- `fg=<color>` — foreground color
- `bg=<color>` — background color
- Effects: `bold`, `italic`, `underscore`, `blink`, `dim`, `strikethrough`, `reverse`, `hidden`

## Colors

`<color>` accepts the same forms as zjstatus:

- `#RRGGBB` — hex RGB (e.g. `#89b4fa`)
- A named color: `black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`,
  `white`, and their `bright_*` variants
- `0`–`255` (or `colour<N>`) — an ANSI 256 color index
- `$name` — a color alias, resolved from the matching `color_<name>` option

> Note: directives zjstatus supports but the hint renderer cannot express
> (e.g. `us=` underline colors and the fancy underline variants) are accepted
> and ignored, so a palette shared with zjstatus never errors.

## Key aliases

By default keys are rendered with their Zellij names (`ENTER`, `ESC`, `TAB`,
`SPACE`, `←`, …). Replace any of them with a symbol using `key_alias_<name>`
options — the same per-line alias pattern as `color_<name>`:

```kdl
key_alias_enter     "↵"
key_alias_space     "␣"
key_alias_esc       "⎋"
key_alias_tab       "⇥"
key_alias_backspace "⌫"
key_alias_left      "←"
```

- `<name>` is the lowercase key name. Aliases apply everywhere the key appears,
  including inside the `{key}` placeholder of a custom `key_format`.
- Keys without an alias keep their default representation, so you only need to
  set the ones you want to change.
- Recognized names: `enter` (`return`), `esc` (`escape`), `tab`, `space`,
  `backspace`, `delete` (`del`), `insert` (`ins`), `home`, `end`,
  `pageup` (`pgup`), `pagedown` (`pgdn`), `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`,
  `capslock`, `scrolllock`, `numlock`, `printscreen`, `pause`, `menu`,
  `f1`–`f12`, and any single character (e.g. `key_alias_x`).

## Modifier aliases

Modifiers work the same way via `mod_alias_<name>`, where `<name>` is one of
`ctrl`, `alt`, `shift`, or `super`:

```kdl
mod_alias_ctrl  "^"
mod_alias_alt   "⌥"
mod_alias_shift "⇧"
mod_alias_super "⌘"
```

Keys sharing a modifier are grouped into a single run, so a set of bindings like
`Ctrl h`, `Alt <`, `Ctrl k`, `Alt l` renders as `^hk ⌥<l` rather than repeating
the modifier four times.

How the modifier joins its keys depends on the alias: a word (`Ctrl`) is
followed by a space (`Ctrl hk`), while a symbol (`^`) hugs them (`^hk`). This is
decided by the last character, so you get the natural spacing either way without
configuring it.

## A complete alias set

A full set using only standard Unicode — no Nerd Font required, and no private-use
codepoints, so it renders in most terminal fonts:

```kdl
// Keys
key_alias_enter     "⏎"
key_alias_esc       "⎋"
key_alias_tab       "⇥"
key_alias_space     "␣"
key_alias_backspace "⌫"
key_alias_delete    "⌦"
key_alias_insert    "⎀"
key_alias_left      "←"
key_alias_down      "↓"
key_alias_up        "↑"
key_alias_right     "→"
key_alias_home      "⇱"
key_alias_end       "⇲"
key_alias_pageup    "⇞"
key_alias_pagedown  "⇟"

// Modifiers
mod_alias_ctrl  "^"
mod_alias_alt   "⌥"
mod_alias_shift "⇧"
mod_alias_super "⌘"
```

Turning `Ctrl Left` into `^←` and `Alt Shift PgDn` into `⌥⇧⇟`.

Nerd Fonts offer alternatives for several of these — arrows, Home/End, Page
Up/Down and Delete all have glyphs in the private-use area. They look sharper if
you have the font, but they render as tofu for anyone who doesn't, so the set
above is the safer default.

> **Width note:** the four arrows and `⇧` are East Asian **Ambiguous**, as are
> all Nerd Font glyphs — see [Glyph width](fitting.md#glyph-width). If your terminal draws
> them double-width, set `ambiguous_width 2` or the hints will overflow slightly.
> The rest of the set above is unambiguously one column.
